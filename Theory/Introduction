🐍 Python Introduction
📌 What is Python?

Python was created in 1991 with a strong focus on code readability and the ability to express concepts using fewer lines of code.
It is a high-level, interpreted programming language widely used across various domains.

🔹 Key Features of Python

Simple and easy-to-read syntax

Variables are automatically typed at runtime (Dynamic Typing)

Reduces code complexity and development time

Beginner-friendly yet powerful

🔹 Programming Paradigms Supported

Python supports multiple programming styles:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Functional Programming

Procedural Programming

This flexibility makes Python suitable for different use cases and project requirements.

🖨️ Print Statement

The print() function is used to display output or text on the screen.

Example:
print("Hello World")

Explanation:

print() is a built-in Python function

It instructs the computer to display the given text or result on the screen

💬 Comments in Python

Comments are used to explain code and make it more readable.
They are ignored by the Python interpreter during execution.

🔹 Single-Line Comment
# This is a single-line comment

🔹 Multi-Line Comment

Python does not have a dedicated multi-line comment syntax, but we commonly use:

'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It can be used to describe larger sections of code.
'''


or

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can be used to describe larger sections of code.
"""

📐 Indentation in Python

Indentation is mandatory in Python and is used to define code blocks.

✅ Correct Indentation
print("Hello")

❌ Incorrect Indentation (Will cause an error)
    print("Hello")


👉 Improper indentation results in an IndentationError.

✅ Summary

Python emphasizes readability and simplicity

Uses dynamic typing

Supports multiple programming paradigms

print() displays output

Comments improve code readability

Indentation is crucial for program structure
