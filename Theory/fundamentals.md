1. Variables in Python

Variables are used to store data values in memory. In Python, you do not need to declare the data type explicitly; it is assigned automatically based on the value.

Key ideas:

Variables hold data

Data type is decided automatically

2. Variable Naming Rules

Valid variable names:

Must start with a letter or underscore

Cannot start with a number

Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores

Should not use Python keywords

3. Assigning Values to Variables

Python allows simple and multiple assignments. Values can be assigned individually or in a single line.

4. Dynamic Typing

Python is dynamically typed, meaning the same variable can store different data types at different times during program execution.

PART 2: STRINGS AND TEXT HANDLING
5. Strings in Python

Strings are sequences of characters used to store text. They are enclosed in single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes.

6. String Concatenation

String concatenation means joining two or more strings together using the + operator.

7. String Repetition

Strings can be repeated using the * operator. This is useful for printing repeated messages.

Escape characters like \n are used to move text to a new line.

8. String Methods

String methods are built-in functions used to manipulate text data.

Important methods:

upper() – Converts text to uppercase

lower() – Converts text to lowercase

strip() – Removes unwanted spaces

replace() – Replaces text with another

9. Multiline Strings

Multiline strings are created using triple quotes. They are useful for storing paragraphs or formatted text.

PART 3: INPUT, OUTPUT, AND DATA TYPES
10. Printing Output

The print() function is used to display output on the screen. It can print text, variables, or multiple values together.

11. Comments in Python

Comments improve code readability and are ignored during execution.

Types:

Single-line comments using #

Multi-line comments using triple quotes

12. User Input

The input() function is used to take input from the user. By default, input is treated as a string.

Type conversion is required for numerical input:

int() for integers

float() for decimal values

13. Taking Multiple Inputs

Multiple inputs can be taken in a single line using the split() method.

14. Data Types in Python

Python supports several built-in data types:

int – Integer numbers

float – Decimal numbers

str – Text data

tuple – Ordered and immutable collection

list – Ordered and mutable collection

dict – Key-value pairs

The type() function is used to identify a variable’s data type.

15. Python Keywords

Python keywords are reserved words with special meaning. They cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.

Python provides a built-in way to view all keywords used in the language.

Final Summary

These notes cover Python fundamentals, string operations, input/output, data types, and keywords. Understanding these concepts forms a strong foundation for
